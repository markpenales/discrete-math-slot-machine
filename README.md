# Discrete Structures Slot Machine Game

This is a fun and interactive slot machine game designed to help students learn about quantifiers and logical statements in Discrete Structures. The game uses randomization and animation to shuffle quantifiers, variables, and predicates, allowing students to identify and analyze various logical components.

## Project Features

- **Slot Machine Animation**: The three slots spin and shuffle randomly, showing quantifiers (`∀`, `∃`), a predicate (`P(x)`), and a variable (`x`).
